# oldJavaGame
Unfinished java game which I was trying to make without having any idea in mind. 

Collision only on a bridge, too lazy to add on the whole map.

This is not the oldest version, oldest version got lost :/ it had a few more skills and skill descriptions
multiplayer not finished, doesn't work. (just sends coords to console)

Learned a lot though

java -cp gameClasses umm
